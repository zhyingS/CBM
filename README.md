## Introduction

We study the problem of inter-agent object association along with inter-agent relative pose estimation to calibrate spatial errors for object-level cooperative perception. 



## Demo

Execute the demo as

```python
python main.py
```

Both ```numpy``` and ```torch```  implementations of $\tt{CBM}$ are available.
